# Implementation conventions & hard-won lessons

Read this before executing any milestone plan. It captures workflow rules and engine gotchas discovered during M1–M3 so they don't get re-learned the hard way. Milestone plans reference this instead of repeating it.

## Workflow

- **One commit + one Bumpy bump file per shippable item** (`vp exec bumpy add --packages "vscode-jisho:<patch|minor>" --name "<slug>" --message "<changelog body>"`; docs-only changes use `--empty`). Commit directly to `main`; Bumpy folds bump files into the version PR.
- **Standing gate after every item:** `vp check` clean (format+lint+typecheck; run `vp check --fix` first) and `vp test` green. Prefer Wallaby MCP for test feedback when alive; fall back to `vp test`.
- **Soft-wrap all Markdown and prose** (commit bodies, docs, comments): one line per paragraph/bullet, no hard column wrapping.
- **Milestone lifecycle:** plan doc exists before work starts → implement in the plan's build order → append an "As-built deviations" section on completion → flip the milestone's status in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
- Plans are starting points, not contracts: when measurements or data reality contradict the plan (it has happened every milestone), follow the measurement and record the deviation.
- Temporary probe scripts go at repo root as `*.tmp.mjs` / `*.tmp.spec.ts`, run, then delete. Note: raw `node` cannot resolve the repo's extensionless relative TS imports — run probes that import `src/` modules through a temp `.spec.ts` via `vp test <file>` instead.

## Turso / SQLite engine gotchas

- **`db.prepare()` is async** — always `await` it (runtime is lenient today; the types are not, and the WASM future won't be).
- **No FTS5.** Turso replaces it with a native Tantivy index (`fts_match`) that we deliberately don't use yet. Search must stay **index-friendly**: exact matches and range scans (`col >= ? AND col < ?||'￿'`) only. **Never add an unanchored `LIKE '%…%'`** — at full-dictionary scale (~3M `search_terms` rows) it costs 400ms–3s per query. Precompute containment at build time instead (see the `word`/`char` kinds in `src/data/schema.sql`).
- **Bulk imports must commit in batches** (~5k rows) with `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` between batches — one giant transaction ballooned the WAL past 5GB. Always checkpoint before `close()` so the shipped `.db` is self-contained.
- Statement results are `any`; route all reads through `Dictionary`'s typed `#all`/`#get` helpers in [src/host/db.ts](../src/host/db.ts).

## Data build & delivery

- `vp run build:data` = common-only dev/test fixture (~30MB, ~16s). `vp run build:data:full` = full dictionary (~320MB, ~4min) + the gzipped release asset trio (`jisho-full.db.gz`, `.sha256`, `.version`).
- **Any schema or data change requires rebuilding both variants** and re-uploading the full trio to the rolling `dictionary-latest` GitHub Release (`gh release upload dictionary-latest --clobber assets/jisho-full.db.gz*`). The `.version` sidecar propagates the refresh to installed clients automatically; the bundled-dev path refreshes F5 automatically.
- Ranking-sensitive changes must keep the db.spec ranking tests green ("study"→勉強, "eat"→食べる above 飲食, "water"→水, "cat"→猫; deinflection: はなします→話す) and should re-run the latency probe on the **full** DB (budget: <150ms; current: 2–75ms).
- **Every new dataset must extend attribution in the same change:** the About view ([src/webview/views/About.tsx](../src/webview/views/About.tsx)), the README's data-sources section, and provenance keys in the DB `meta` table.

## Host ↔ webview

- The message contract lives in [src/shared/messages.ts](../src/shared/messages.ts): request/response pairs correlated by `requestId`. **DTOs must be plain structured-clone-safe objects** (no Map/Set/Date). New requests: add types → `Dictionary` method → `respond()` case in [src/extension.ts](../src/extension.ts) → bridge function → TanStack Query options in [src/webview/queries.ts](../src/webview/queries.ts).
- **State ownership line (hold it):** TanStack Query = all async state (bridge calls as `queryFn`) · XState navigation machine ([src/webview/machines/navigation.ts](../src/webview/machines/navigation.ts)) = view stack + UI state · React Aria = interaction primitives · CVA + CSS Modules over `--vscode-*` vars = styling (no hardcoded colors, no `prefers-color-scheme`) · RHF+Valibot reserved for real forms.
- New views: extend the machine's `View` union + an event + a case in [src/webview/App.tsx](../src/webview/App.tsx). The search view stays mounted via React `<Activity>`; pushed views render as siblings.
- The webview targets one known Chromium (Electron) — no cross-browser fallbacks needed. CSP: scripts need the nonce; assets via `webview.cspSource`.

## Packaging

- `@tursodatabase/*` is `neverBundle`d and ships in the `.vsix` from `node_modules`; everything else the host imports gets bundled into `dist/extension.cjs` (verify externals stay `vscode` + `@tursodatabase/database` only: `grep -oE 'require\("[^"]+"\)' dist/extension.cjs`).
- `vsce` always with `--no-yarn` (its yarn integration is Yarn-v1-only). Per-platform packages: `vp run build:platforms` (4 targets; **no darwin-x64** — turso ships no Intel-Mac binary). Bumpy's build/publish commands already point at the platform scripts.
- The manifest has **no `browser` field** until M8 — the host is Node-only today.
